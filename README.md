# Electricity Demand Forecasting – Personal Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains a self-directed machine learning project exploring short-term electricity demand forecasting using publicly available data from the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).

The project focuses on the **VIC1** region and uses **5-minute interval** demand data to build a **feature-based Random Forest regression** model.

---

## Purpose
This project was created for **self-learning and hobby use**.

It is intended as a practical way to learn and practice:
- Time-series feature engineering  
- Supervised regression modeling  
- Preventing data leakage with time-based splits  
- Model evaluation (MAE) and interpretation  
- Working with real-world energy market datasets  

---

## Approach
The notebook is written in a **mini research project format**, inspired by my time working in research.  
It includes:
- Introduction & hypothesis  
- Data description  
- Method (feature engineering + model choice)  
- Results & visualisations  
- Discussion and limitations  
- Conclusion and next steps  
- Feature importance analysis  

The goal is to showcase not only the outcome but also the reasoning process behind each step.
